//! NVM works by instrumenting the types which are to be mocked. The instrumentation consists of two parts:
//! 1) a mechanism which communicates when an instance of the type is a mock.
//! 2) a system for redirecting calls to member functions into their mock equivalents.
//!
//! This instrumentation can be accomplished either via inheriting nvm::mockable publicly or by placing 
//! NVM_IMPLEMENTS_MOCKABLE() at the public scope of the type.
//! For simple types where no ancestor type is mockable, NVM_IMPLEMENTS_MOCKABLE() is probably the preferred strategy.
//! If the type has a complex ancestry where ancestor types are mockable in their own right, inheritance
//! of nvm::mockable is probably preferred.
